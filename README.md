# Your Project Title — Showcase (Bolt.new / Bolt.ai)

> A GitHub-ready template to showcase a project built with **Bolt.new / Bolt.ai**.
> Replace placeholders with your project's name, description, screenshots, and Bolt-exported source.

## What this repo contains
- `template/` — a small static demo site (HTML/CSS) you can open locally or use as a landing page.
- `bolt-export/` — a placeholder folder where you can drop the source exported from Bolt.new.
- `SHOWCASE.md` — guidance and copy snippets to create a compelling project README for visitors.
- `.gitignore`, `LICENSE` (MIT), and `upload_to_github.sh` — helper files to get your repo online quickly.

## Quick start (3 options)

### 1) Simple — show a static landing page
1. Download and unzip this repo.
2. Open `template/index.html` in your browser to preview the showcase page.

### 2) Replace with Bolt export (recommended)
1. Export your app from Bolt.new (download the source ZIP).
2. Unzip and copy your exported project files into the `bolt-export/` folder, overwriting placeholders.
3. Update this `README.md` with project title, description, and demo link (if deployed).

### 3) Deploy to the web
- Deploy `template/` or the contents of `bolt-export/` to **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or **GitHub Pages**.
  - For Vercel: `vercel` command or drag & drop the folder in the Vercel dashboard.
  - For GitHub Pages (static): push the repo and enable Pages from `main` branch -> `/template` (or root after moving files).

## How to use this template
1. Replace the placeholder text (project title, description) in `README.md`.
2. Add at least one screenshot to `docs/` and update the "Screenshots" section below.
3. Commit and push to your GitHub repo. Use `upload_to_github.sh` as a helper (edit remote URL first).
