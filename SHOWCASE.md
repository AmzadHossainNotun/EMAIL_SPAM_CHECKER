# How to write a great project showcase (short guide)

Use this checklist to make your GitHub project shine.

## 1. Elevator pitch (1–2 lines)
Describe what the app does and who it's for. Example:
> A lightweight CRM built with Bolt.new that helps freelancers track clients and invoices.

## 2. Live demo / GIF
- Add a link to a deployed demo (Vercel/Netlify).
- Add a short animated GIF or screenshots in `docs/`.

## 3. Features (bullet list)
- Auth, CRUD, search, integrations — list the main value props.

## 4. Tech & architecture
- Mention Bolt.new export + runtime (Next.js, Vite, Astro, etc.)
- Add a small architecture diagram or bullet list of services (DB, auth, hosting).

## 5. How to run locally
Provide the minimal steps to run the app locally (install, build, start).

## 6. Licence & contact
Include a license (MIT) and how others can contact you or try the demo.

## Copy snippets (fill and paste)
**One-line:** `ProjectName — A [what it does] built with Bolt.new.`

**About paragraph:**  
`ProjectName is a lightweight [type] built with Bolt.new. It includes [features]. Exported from Bolt.new and lightly customized.`
